# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_EMPLOYEE_DATA

This project, titled Employee Data Analysis & Dashboard, was developed as part of a group assignment under the guidance of UNP Education. Using a raw dataset named Employee Data, we performed a complete data analysis process within Microsoft Excel. The project involved data cleaning, column formatting, handling missing values, and grouping categorical data to prepare it for analysis. Key metrics such as occupation distribution, income types, asset ownership, and communication preferences were explored using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. An interactive dashboard was then designed to present the insights in a visually appealing and user-friendly format, incorporating slicers and filters for dynamic exploration. This project showcases practical skills in data preprocessing, Excel-based analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation, highlighting the ability to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.
